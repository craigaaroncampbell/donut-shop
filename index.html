      <h2>About This Site</h2>
      <p>Not many people know this, but "I want to see a scary headless guy" is actually neighborhood in Seattle. True story.This page is a model for the number of doughnuts that various Top Pot Doughnut Caf&#233s need to make every hour. It assumes all stores are open from 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Use the Add/Edit Store input to add a store of your own! You specify the location, minimum number of customers  in an hour, maximum number of customers, and the average amount of donuts that each customer buys.
      </p>
      </p>
     The "super duper magic calculator" (aka JavaScript program that I wrote) will calculate a random number of customers in between your min and max values. It then multiplies that random number by the average amount of doughnuts that each customer will buy! <em> Preety Schnazzy!</em> The "super duper magic calculator" repeats this calculation for every hour that the doughnut shops are open. Yes, that's 11 whole hours!  And since the number of customers is random each hour, you get different numbers. Oh yeah. An then the calculator adds these all up and tells you approximately how many doughnuts to make for EACH shop! Wow!
      </p>

      <h3> But wait... There's more!</h3>

      <p>Did I mention that it then CREATES A TABLE OUT OF THIN AIR? Yes it does!  Thanks to the magic of DOM manipulation, a data table is created right before your very eyes! You don't notice this  because the data table is there when load this page, but it was created <em>in situ</em>! Ok the hours  data cells are "permanently" part of the page, but then what does "permanent" mean anyway?  But try it for yourself!  When you make new location, the data table just appears out of thin air!
