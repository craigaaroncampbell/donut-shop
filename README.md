TO GET THE SHARK-DONUT ANIMATION TO REPEAT, JUST RELOAD THE PAGE!


Donut shop assignment for week 2 of CF Bootcamp

I used 'Quicksand', sans-serif font from Google for the header


I used 'Vidaloka', serif font for hte text below the header.

Color Scheme from Adobe Color CC (Birdfolio Blues scheme):
  #223242 - blue-black (main text)
  #3F5765 - blue-grey (table border)
  #BDD4DE - light blue (background)
  #EFEFEF - white  (footer border)
  #FF530D - orange  (headers)



Relative position: text to the right of the picture (id = "around picture")

Fixed position: header (Craig's Super Cool Donut Calculating Model)

absolute position: footer  (copyright)


And there are some Easter eggs too. hooray!
